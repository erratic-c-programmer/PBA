The opponent is allowed to ban up to one map from the map pick. The roles are reversed for the second game. Players are free to make exceptions from this rule at the discretion of both parties.\n  4.1.2.1 If a player wants to ban a map from his opponent's pick he should do that before the pick.\n  4.1.2.2 A player should be allowed to ban a map if he wishes to do so; so if a map is picked without asking to invoke the map ban, then a player is still allowed to ban a map afterwards.\n  4.1.3 First map pick is pre-set by officials for Tiebreaker and Playoffs matches, followed by loser's pick.\n\nGood luck commanders!
